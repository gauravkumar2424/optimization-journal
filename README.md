## Project Overview

This repository is focused on the study and practical implementation of mathematical optimization techniques, specifically **Linear Programming Problems (LPP)** and **Nonlinear Optimization (NLO)**.  
The core purpose is to apply foundational mathematical concepts to real-world engineering and embedded systems scenarios.  
By working through various problems and case studies, this project bridges the gap between mathematical theory and practical devops applications.

## Key Objectives

- Explore and practice mathematical modeling for optimization.
- Develop Python solutions for LPP and NLO problems.
- Connect mathematical concepts to embedded engineering, firmware, and system design.
- Build a reference toolkit for revision and interview preparation.

## Areas Covered

### Linear Programming (LP)
- Formulation and graphical solutions
- Simplex method and algorithmic approaches
- Python implementations (using [PuLP](https://github.com/coin-or/pulp))
- Applications: resource allocation, scheduling, constraint management in embedded systems

### Nonlinear Optimization (NLO)
- Gradient-based algorithms (gradient descent)
- Metaheuristics (genetic algorithms, simulated annealing)
- Python implementations (using `scipy`, custom scripts)
- Applications: signal processing, control, hardware optimization

### Embedded DevOps Applications
- Modeling constraints (battery, memory, processing time)
- Scheduling and resource optimization for microcontrollers and IoT devices
- Translating optimization results into practical engineering solutions

## Getting Started

To use the materials in this repository:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/gauravkumar2424/optimization-journal
   ```
2. **Install Python 3.10 or later.**
3. **Install required packages** for each script (see script headers for details, commonly: `pip install pulp scipy numpy`).
4. **Browse the folders and scripts** for LP and NLO examples.
5. **Run scripts and modify parameters** to experiment with different models and applications.

## How to Use
